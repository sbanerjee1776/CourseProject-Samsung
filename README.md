# CourseProject-Samsung

This repo contains the run_analysis.R file and the CodeBook.md file

The CodeBook.md file explains the run_analysis.R file and explains all the variables in the tidy data set that is generated by the run_analysis.R file

The run_analysis.R file completes the steps necessary for the Course Project:
* Combines the training and test data sets into a combined data set(frame)
* Extracts the measurements that are the mean and standard deviations for each measurement
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels each column in the dataset to be meaningful
* Creates a tidy data set from the previous step with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
* The tidy data set is written to tidyData.txt file and written in the working directory

IMPORTANT: The working directory must contain the run_analysis.R scrip as well as the "UCI HAR Dataset" directory

The dplyr package is needed for the analysis. The run_analysis.R file checks if this is available and loaded.
